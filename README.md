# python_projects
These are few of my very very simple python projects

1. Logger:- This can be used to log the workouts and diet meals seperately, regardless of that the data can be retrieve particularly

2. Star Pattern:- This is just a simple code which takes a number from you as an input (as rows) and also asks for the pattern style you want and then print accordingly
