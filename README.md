# python_projects
These are few of my extremely simple python projects

1. Logger:- This can be used to log the workouts and diet meals seperately, regardless of that the data can be retrieved particularly

2. Star Pattern:- This is just a simple code which takes a number from you as an input (as rows) and also asks for the pattern style you want and then print accordingly

3. Stone Paper Scissor:- Many of us have played this game with friends (humans), let's try once palying with a machine

4. Healthy Programmer:- This program is intended to take care of the health of programmers, works as an audio reminder system (audio files included) and tells that how a programmer can take care of his/her health even while working.

5. Euclidean Distance:- This program is intended to find the "Euclidean Distance" between the given two coordinates.

  i. Input:- 
  >> test_cases = "n" (number of test_cases),
  >> values = x1, y1, x2, y2 (values for each test case)

  ii. Output:-
  >> Distance: x.xx (distance between the given coordinates)

6. Library Manager:- Just a demo/prototype version of an actual and optimal library management application software.
